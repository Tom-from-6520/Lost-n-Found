# Lost N Found Web Application

## Introduction
This project is a group assignment for CS360: Database in Gettysburg College. 
We hope that our idea will be useful for the community.

## Project description (to be updated)
* Server scripting: PHP
* Database: MySQL
* Front-end: Bootstrap alongside with simple HTML and CSS

## Setup
The database server is part of our school server, so the project is yet to be available for the public. 

We utilize Github's hosting ability to cooperate better for our project

We keep a list of TODOs to manage our project up to deadlines' demands.
